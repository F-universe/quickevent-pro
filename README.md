QuickEvent Pro is a minimalist web app that helps you manage and track countdowns for all
your important events. You can add as many events as you want, pick an emoji or icon for each, 
and get automatic browser notifications when an event is less than 24 hours away. 
Events are sorted by date, and you can mark them as completed without deleting them. 
Switch easily between dark and light themes.

How to use:
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open index.html with any modern browser.
3. Add an event by entering a name, picking a date, and optionally adding an emoji.
4. The countdown for each event will update in real time.
5. Mark events as “done” or delete them at any time.
6. Switch between dark and light modes using the top button.

All your data is stored locally in your browser. No account or installation needed. Works on any modern browser.

Project created to enrich your portfolio with a simple, useful, and well-structured app.
